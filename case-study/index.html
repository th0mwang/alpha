<h1>Overview</h1>
<p1>This case study is for my final project in my IDM241 class, in which I had redesigned the YouTube thumbnail along with its microinteractions. I had decided to work on the thumbnail specifically as I have noticed that it regularly goes through fairly changes and redesigns and I wanted to give my input on some of those changes.  I had borrowed some elements from previous iterations of this design (ie: the add to watch later playlist button) but added some of my own ideas to them.  I had talked to a few friends about how they felt about the YouTube thumbnail before I started and surprisingly, I was not the only one who had quite a few thoughts about this as they also shared similar thoguhts to mine on the matter.</p1>

<h1>Context & Challenge</h1>
<p1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background</strong><br>For my IDM241 class' final project, we had to find a micro-interaction on a website and
improve upon it</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong><br>  I had chosen YouTube's thumbnail as my project and the main change I made was initially, the only visible part is the thumbnail, then when you hover onto it with your cursor,
a card with the video name, the username of the uploader, profile picture of the user, the viewcount and how long ago the video was uploaded scroll down into view right below the video.  If your cursor leaves the video, then it would slide back to its initial spot, covering the card and  would return to the thumbnail image.</li>
<li><strong>Timeline</strong><br>  The final project all together took about 3 weeks to complete, but the class was 10 weeks long</li>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong><br>  I made the on hover scrolling feature as a way to put more attention onto the thumbnails initially when you look at them.<br>
I had replaced the mute/unmute & closed caption buttons with a "Watch Later" button as I had asked for a few other people's opinions prior to designing to get some other opinions.  A few of them mentioned that they wished YouTube had kept the "Watch Later" button in a convenient spot like it had been before instead of having the controls to watching the preview of the video like we have now. 
<br>I also had a little title card pop out as well if hover on the profile picture so you can get some information about the YouTuber
</li>
<li><strong>The Problem</strong><br></li>I decided on improving on the thumbnails as I feel like they have been through many changes through recent years and while I do like some of these changes, there were a few I was not a fan of, like them replacing the location of the add to "Watch Later Playlist" with a mute button and closed caption button for the preview.
<li><strong>Goals & Objectives</strong><br></li>I will know if I was successful with my project if people give it a try and don't have any questions about how to use it as I wanted it to be intuitive
</ul>

<h1>Process & Insight</h1>
<ul>
    <li>In coming up with the design, I had asked a few peoplel about what they would like to see or see get rid of in a YouTube thumbnail redesign</li>
    <li>I had looked at other video streaming services and how they handled thumbnails for inspiration, I didn't want to copy them exactly as a streaming service's thumbnail and a YouTube thumbnail are fairly different</li>
</ul>

<div id="Results">
<p1>I would say for me personally, this project was success as it is the biggest project I have done up until this date (12/12/23) and I have learned quite a bit during the process, not only about coding, but how to interview people about what and asking what they would like to see in designs. I had showed it to the people who I asked and they all liked it and noted the changes I had made.  All in all, I would say this project was a success for me</p1>
