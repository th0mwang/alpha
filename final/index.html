        <div class="grid-item"><p1>Rules:</p1><br>Upon hover, there would be a cursor change, the thumbnail would also scroll up and reveal the name of the video, the creator of the video & viewcount underneath as well as start playing the video muted.  Upon hover off, the thumbnail would transition back to its default state with the thumbnail image and back into where it was initally.  
            If you click on the video, upon click, the video and text would darken until click release. If you hover on the profile picture, there will be a cursor change and on click a popup will appear and transition in 0.3 seconds that has the channel information and on click off, it'll disappear.  When the thumbnail scolls up along side the text, there is an add to playlist button on the far
        right at 50% opacity and on hover it goes to 100% opacity and on click it would shrink for a moment then return to its original size and have its color be inverted.</div>
